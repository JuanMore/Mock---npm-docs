# Mock --npm-docs
This a makeshift npm docs and get started website for npm.
Made with html, css and includes javascript for dynamic text replacement. 
Inspired by a Brad Traversy tutorial which I turned into a mock npm site! I enjoyed working on this because I learned how to styling methods I didn't quite understand and practicing grids, flex and media queries in a way that showcased text and documentation over more elaborate details or images. This was a great learning experience and I'll continue to work on my basic html and css skills!
